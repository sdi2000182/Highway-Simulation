## Introduction

This C++ Highway Simulation project is a software application that simulates a highway system with segments, entrances, and tolls using object-oriented programming.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

- **Highway**: Represents the main highway system, consisting of multiple segments.
- **Segment**: Represents a section of the highway where vehicles travel.
- **Entrance**: Represents an entrance point to the highway where vehicles can join.
- **Toll**: Represents a toll booth where vehicles may be required to pay a fee.
